There was an old man with a beard
Who said, 'It is just as I feared,
Two owls and a hen
A lark and a wren
Have all built their nests in my beard!

An era, midst its dim arena
Elapses pale.
No, in uneven union
Liars, alas, rail.

Drab as a fool, as aloof as a bard.

I can resist everything except temptation

Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?

Wake up to a bright sapphire morning 
Cloudless skies
This can only mean one thing
Itâ€™s a go!

An era, midst its dim arena
Elapses pale.
No, in uneven union
Liars, alas, rail.


The final leaf falls
The tree branches are so bare
Autumn has arrived
